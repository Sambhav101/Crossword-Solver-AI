# Crossword-Solver-AI

an AI that uses backtracking algorithm and inference to calculate the right variables to store in the crossword. The project is based on Harvard online course CS50: Intro to Artificial Intelligence.

User can pass the words dictionary and layout of the crossword board using # for black box and empty space for white space like the one shown in structure1.txt. The 
AI will try to solve the crossword by enforcing node consistency, arc consistency, and backtracking algorithm to find the right variables and solve the board.
